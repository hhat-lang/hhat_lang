# Python Implementation of H-hat

Python implementation of H-hat. It includes the rule system and key features for development of the
language, and a reference dialect ([Heather](dialects/heather/README.md)) to evaluate H-hat code.

## Installation

Choose **one** of the options below to install it.

### 1. From source

1. Download the repository and git clone it on terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hhat-lang/hhat_lang.git
```

2. Have at least `Python`(`>=3.12`) installed on your computer. Check the link
   on [how to install Python on your system](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

3. Go to `python/` folder and create a virtual environment for
   python ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments), hatch,
   conda or poetry
   are some options available).
4. Enable the virtual environment and pip install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

### 2. Using `Pypi`

> [!NOTE]
>
> This method should not be used for now. The code contained in the `hhat-lang` package is outdated.

## Next steps

### H-hat package

You can start playing with H-hat's core components to build your own H-hat dialect (import as
`hhat_lang`), or use Heather
dialect to run H-hat code directly. More information
at [Heather's README](dialects/heather/README.md).

### H-hat CLI

After installing it, you should be able to use
H-hat [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) to prepare the environment for a
new H-hat project.
